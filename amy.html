      <p><strong>Cdr Amy Gilmore MBE RN</strong></p>

      <figure style="margin: 12px 0 18px 0;">
        <img

          alt="Commander Amy Gilmore MBE RN"

      <p>
        Amy was the kind of person who made things feel lighter, even on the hard days. She had a rare mix of warmth and drive:
        the sort of friend who would send a voice note to check in, organise the plan, and then make you laugh until you forgot why
        you were stressed in the first place.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a Royal Navy officer, Amy led with quiet confidence. She set high standards, but never by talking down to anyone.
        She made people feel capable. She noticed the person who was being overlooked, brought them into the fold, and made sure
        they left stronger than they arrived. The “MBE” after her name speaks to her service — but the real measure of Amy was
        the number of people who felt supported, encouraged, and seen because she was in their corner.
      </p>

      <p>
        She loved being outdoors, loved a challenge, and loved the feeling of earning something step by step. The South West Coast
        Path captured that spirit perfectly: big horizons, honest effort, and moments of joy tucked between the tough sections.
        Amy didn’t just want to complete it — she wanted to bring people with her, to turn a personal goal into a shared adventure.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Be More Amy” is our way of keeping that spirit alive. It’s not about being the fastest, the fittest, or the most experienced.
        It’s about showing up, doing what you can, and lifting others as you go — with humour, kindness, and determination.
        That’s what Amy did, every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        This relay carries her with us: in the stories we tell, the friends we make along the way, and the care we raise for the
        charities that mattered to her and her loved ones. However far you go, you’re part of Amy’s team.
      </p>
