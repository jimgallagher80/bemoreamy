<h1>Charities</h1>

<p>
We would greatly appreciate any fundraising efforts going towards the charities and organisations that helped Amy and those closest to her throughout her battle with cancer.
</p>

<!-- Breast Cancer Now -->
<section class="charity-section">

  </a>

  <h2>Breast Cancer Now</h2>

  <p>
  When Amy was first diagnosed, Breast Cancer Now helped us navigate the immense and life-changing shift that such a diagnosis brings. Their support, resources and guidance provided clarity and reassurance at a time when everything felt uncertain.

<!-- Make 2nds Count -->

  </a>

  <h2>Make 2nds Count</h2>

  <p>
  After a two-year period of remission, filled with Ironman training, earning an MBE and running the Fleet Flagship, Amy’s cancer returned as a stage 4 diagnosis. This meant seeking new and innovative treatments. Make 2nds Count played a vital role during this stage, and Amy was passionate about championing their work so that others could benefit as we did.

  </a>

  <h2>Weldmar Hospice</h2>

  <p>
  As Amy entered the palliative care stage, Weldmar Hospice provided immeasurable relief and compassionate care in a beautifully calm, peaceful and dignified setting. They made an incredibly difficult period much more bearable for all of us.

<!-- Military vs Cancer -->

  <a href="https://www.militaryvscancer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>

  <h2>Military vs Cancer</h2>

  <p>
  Supporting serving personnel and their families at every stage of this disease is the small yet powerful charity Military vs Cancer. Their work in advocating for and looking after the military community deserves recognition and support.
